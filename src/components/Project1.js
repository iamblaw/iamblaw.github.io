        About Me
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am a student from Thess Bronx, New York attending Lehman College. I am a student of 
        Prof. Flowers who teaches CMP 464. In this class we are learning react which is a
        javascript library famously created and maintained by Facebook (now referred to as Meta).
        I not only believe but understand that technology is the future and being apart of it makes
        me happy.
